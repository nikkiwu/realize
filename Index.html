    <p>South Korean label IISE unveils a new lookbook for its Spring/Summer 2018 “Collection 006” range, which echoes the balance and symmetry of traditional Korean furniture. The seasonal collection is anchored by a clean color palette of navy, black, white and beiges, with a pop of burgundy for some rich vibrancy.

        The unisex range includes outerwear silhouettes such as long coats, track jackets, bombers, panel coach jackets and tech vests featuring color-blocking and linear designs. Other staples such as bowler shirts, essential tee, track bottoms and lounge pants round out the essential collection. All pieces are made with premium linen and materials sourced from Korea.
